# Simple Rusty TCP Server

This project is a simple TCP server written in Rust. It uses the standard library's networking and I/O modules to accept and handle TCP connections.

## Modules

The project is divided into several modules:

`utils`: This module contains utility functions that are used across the project.
`http`: This module handles the HTTP response generation based on the received request.
`error`: This module defines custom error types for the project.
`guess`: Provides functions for the guessing game users play.

## Main Functionality

The main functionality of the server is encapsulated in the handle_client function. This function takes a mutable TcpStream as an argument, reads data from it into a buffer, handles the response using the http::handle_response function, formats the response, and then writes the response back to the client.

**Running the Project**
To run the project, you need to have Rust installed on your machine. You can then use the cargo run command in the project's root directory.

Please note that this is a basic TCP server and it might not handle all edge cases or errors gracefully. It's a good starting point for learning about TCP servers in Rust, but it might need modifications and improvements for production use.

## Future Enhancements

The current implementation of the Rust TCP server serves as a solid foundation for understanding the basics of TCP networking and Rust's standard library capabilities. To further enhance the learning experience and improve the server's functionality and performance, the following additions are planned:

### Thread Pools:

**Objective**: Implement thread pools to efficiently manage and reuse a limited number of threads for handling multiple client connections. This will prevent the overhead of creating and destroying threads for each connection, leading to better resource utilization and scalability.
**Learning Outcome**: Gain deeper insights into concurrent programming in Rust, thread management, and how to balance load across multiple threads.

### Async:

**Objective**: Refactor the server to handle requests asynchronously, allowing it to perform non-blocking I/O operations. This change aims to enhance the server's ability to handle a large number of connections simultaneously without waiting for I/O operations to complete, thus improving throughput and responsiveness.
**Learning Outcome**: Understand the principles of asynchronous programming in Rust, including futures, and tasks which is commonly used for writing asynchronous applications in Rust.

### Async Multi-Threaded:

**Objective**: Combine the benefits of asynchronous programming with multi-threading to develop a highly scalable and efficient server. This involves using an asynchronous runtime that supports multi-threading to handle numerous connections across multiple threads without blocking.
**Learning Outcome**: Learn to leverage Rust's powerful concurrency features and async ecosystem to build high-performance networked applications that can scale across multiple cores and handle a high volume of concurrent connections.

### Benchmarking and Optimization:

**Objective**: After implementing the above enhancements, perform thorough benchmarking to identify bottlenecks and optimize the server's performance. This may include optimizing memory usage, reducing latency, and increasing throughput.
**Learning Outcome**: Develop skills in performance profiling, benchmarking Rust applications, and applying optimizations to improve efficiency and speed.

These enhancements are intended to not only improve the project's capabilities but also provide a hands-on learning experience with advanced Rust programming concepts. Each step will bring its own set of challenges and learning opportunities, making the project an excellent resource for those looking to dive deeper into network programming and concurrency in Rust.
